I'm a scientist working at [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/), a research non-profit based in New York City. My academic background is in ecology and conservation. I received my PhD from the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, where I was part of the lab of [Dr. Brian Todd](http://toddlab.ucdavis.edu/).

In general, I use statistical modeling to answer questions about the ecology of wildlife populations. This information provides a basis for understanding infectious diseases (both of wildlife and people) and for guiding conservation efforts. Increasingly, I have attempted to improve the transparency and reproducibility of my work by employing open source tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and by posting materials publicly using [GitHub](https://github.com/eveskew). 

Use this site to find out more about me, or take a look at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2tSgJwAAAAJ&hl=en).
