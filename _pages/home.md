I'm a scientist at [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/), a research non-profit based in New York City. My academic background is in ecology and conservation. I received my PhD from the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, where I worked with [Dr. Brian Todd](http://toddlab.ucdavis.edu/).

Broadly, I use statistical methods to answer questions about wildlife ecology. This information provides a basis for understanding infectious diseases (both of wildlife and humans) and for guiding conservation efforts. Increasingly, I've aimed to improve the transparency and reproducibility of my work by employing open source tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and by posting materials publicly using [GitHub](https://github.com/eveskew). 

Use this site to learn more about my work, or take a look at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2tSgJwAAAAJ&hl=en).
