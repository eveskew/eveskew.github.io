I'm a [One Health data scientist](https://www.iids.uidaho.edu/onehealth.php) with the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Sciences](https://www.iids.uidaho.edu/about.php) at the University of Idaho. I received my PhD from the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, where I studied with [Dr. Brian Todd](http://toddlab.ucdavis.edu/). Subsequently, I worked as a research scientist at the non-profit organization [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/) and conducted postdoctoral studies in the lab of [Dr. Brooke Maslo](https://maslolab.wordpress.com/) at Rutgers University.

Using the One Health concept as an organizing principle for my research, I aim to produce information that can guide applied conservation efforts and improves our understanding of infectious diseases in both wildlife and humans. Specific systems of interest include fungal diseases of wildlife, zoonoses like Lassa fever and Rift Valley fever, and the global wildlife trade. I work with many collaborators, including [Dr. Scott Nuismer](https://www.leeef.org/) at the University of Idaho, the [Global Health-Kenya](https://vetmed.wsu.edu/departments/paul-g-allen-school-for-global-health/wsu-global-health-kenya/) team at Washington State University, and members of the [Viral Emergence Research Initiative (VERENA)](https://www.viralemergence.org/).

I also have a variety of teaching experience. From 2020 to 2022, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biology](https://www.plu.edu/biology/) at Pacific Lutheran University. Prior to that, I served as an adjunct research scientist within Columbia University's department of [Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology](http://e3b.columbia.edu/), where I taught [statistics for ecology and evolution](https://github.com/eveskew/stats_eco_evo_spring2020). And as a graduate instructor at UC Davis, I led an undergraduate discussion course on the [social construction of nature and wilderness](/assets/docs/Nature_Wilderness_Conservation_Syllabus.pdf).
