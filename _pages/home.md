I'm currently a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources](https://deenr.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University, working in the lab of [Dr. Brooke Maslo](https://maslolab.wordpress.com/). I received my PhD from the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, where I studied with [Dr. Brian Todd](http://toddlab.ucdavis.edu/), and I subsequently worked as a research scientist at the non-profit organization [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/).

Broadly, I use statistics to answer questions about wildlife ecology. The information I produce helps guide conservation efforts and improves our understanding of infectious diseases, both in wildlife and humans. Increasingly, I've worked towards research transparency and reproducibility by employing open source tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and by posting materials publicly using [GitHub](https://github.com/eveskew). 

I'm also affiliated with Columbia University's department of [Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology](http://e3b.columbia.edu/) as an adjunct research scientist, and I've taught [statistics for ecology and evolution](https://github.com/eveskew/stats_eco_evo_spring2019) in the department.
