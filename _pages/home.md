I'm a scientist at [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/), a research non-profit based in New York City. I received my PhD from the [Graduate Group in Ecology](http://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis, where I worked with [Dr. Brian Todd](http://toddlab.ucdavis.edu/).

Broadly, I use statistical methods to answer questions about wildlife ecology. This information provides a basis for understanding infectious diseases (both of wildlife and humans) and for guiding conservation efforts. Increasingly, I've aimed to improve the transparency and reproducibility of my work by employing open source tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and by posting materials publicly using [GitHub](https://github.com/eveskew). 

I'm also affiliated with Columbia University's department of [Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology](http://e3b.columbia.edu/) as an adjunct research scientist and have taught [statistics for ecology and evolution](https://github.com/eveskew/stats_eco_evo_spring2019) in the department.
